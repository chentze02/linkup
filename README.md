There are two types of users in our mobile application: the verified recruiter and the open-to-join applicant.

The recruiter directly interacts with data that applicants have uploaded as
aforementioned, and can then input an expected graduation year filter and location
filter if they want to narrow their search.

Users upload their resume, professional photo, description, and basic contact
information (year and location) to our mobile app.

Professional recruiters then use our database of profiles and swipe right or left on
resumes to either accept or reject the candidate.

FEATURES:
- Swipe left and right on candidates
- Bookmark highly qualified candidate profiles
- Notification center that notifies candidates of recruiters that have swiped right on them
